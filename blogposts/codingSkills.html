           Here are some things I think are important in order for someone to get good at coding who is starting from zero.
           <br><br>
           I think all these things are equally or even more important than your basic “be good at logical thinking”, “be good at maths” and that those skills themselves get improved while you learn to code, while at the same time helping you to do so.
            <br><br>
           <strong> Curiosity. </strong>
           You will want to have that “But I want to know how it works” kind of attitude. This is the starting point and you will not get far if you are not being inquisitive.
           <br><br>
           <strong> Playfulness. </strong>
           Learning to code means playing around with code.
           Changing bits here and there and observing the effects, trying things out.
           Sometimes it means copying pieces from Stackoverflow and seeing what they do.
           Yes, we all do that in one way or another.
           <br><br>
           <strong> Patience and Endurance. </strong>
           Especially in the beginning when things don’t work the way they are supposed to you feel like there could be about a million reasons for that.
           Anything from a Syntax error, to your IDE, to the network connection, you don´t even know where to start.
           It is often really hard to fix bugs and find errors, and get things to work the way you want them to, and sometimes you need to spend a long time going through forum after forum, annoying your developer friends, and slowly puzzling together a solution.
           Sometimes you don´t find a solution, because the technology you are using doesn’t offer one and you painfully have to find that out.
           <br><br>
           <strong> A sense of standard. </strong>
           I have worked in teams with people where they just wrote the quickest possible ugly hack, or just dumped some pile of ugly code.
           While sometimes you are just making a project for yourself, or University or a Hackathon and it is not built to last, there is something that does help me a lot: A friend once told me “Don´t give something out of your hand, which is not made to the best of your abilities.”
           If you want to get better at coding, you need to try and do things to the best of your abilities, to test your limits and to set a certain standard for yourself.
           If you can do better than you did, then do it better.
           <br><br>

           <strong> Get help. </strong>
           While you can solve pretty much every (beginners) bug by browsing Stackoverflow for a long enough time, getting into a community or finding some developer friends who are more experienced, is kind of necessary to find out about how to actually write code that is also nice and not just does as it should. In the beginning, whether you write the code like this, or like that might seem the same to you. However people who have worked in this field for years, might be able to tell you about some best practices that allow you to write nicer code.
           <br><br>
           <strong> Try and write nice code. </strong>
           If you start learning to code by actually caring about things like proper indentation, and later on paying attention to other stuff like the S.O.L.I.D principles, coding becomes a lot easier.
           I have witnessed people still writing all the C++ code in one long line after the first semester of coding at University, and the thing is that you only make it harder for yourself. If you structure your code nicely, if you make sure one class has only one responsibility, that your methods do not get too long, that your naming is on-point, you will have it so much easier when you want to debug or refactor your code.
           As a kind of guideline, try writing code in a way that other people can read and understand it. As one of my friends puts it: "Nobody will give you a gold star for clever, complicated code that only you can maintain".
           I wrote a self-balancing B+tree in C++ in the second University semester, without minding too many of those things, and after a certain amount of lines of code it just got really hard to understand my own code and I spent weeks, days, nights debugging it.
           <br><br>
           <strong> Overcoming fears. </strong>
           I know quite a few people, including myself, who started learning IT and were afraid of breaking something. Because there are usually too many things going on at once to understand everything that is happening, ranging from what exactly is happening in memory when you start overwriting memory spaces by using pointers, to having to wipe a hard disk and installing a new OS. Of course you can break things, and delete stuff you needed (That’s why it is important to have backups!), but you still need to try it, even if it seems impossibly out of your reach. Often we are afraid of not being good enough for doing something, and we feel really lost when things happen we have never seen before, but this is something we kind of need to put aside. I remember the first time I took apart a computer to add an SSD I was terrified. However computers, technology, code are tools that we can learn to utilize and use.
           <br><br>
           <strong> Learn to ask good questions. </strong>
           This is a really important one, also for me personally. Developers do not like stupid questions.
           This being questions along the lines of “It doesn´t work. Why doesn’t it work?” without further explanations.
           There is <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"> literature </a> out there on how to ask good questions and if you want to get help, then learn to ask questions that are not annoying or insulting to the people you want answers from. Show them that you invested time into finding a solution, and that you do not just want them to think for you because you are lazy.
           <br><br>
           <strong> Keep at it. </strong>
           As with any skill, keep at it. Find yourself some projects, and try and see them through.
           <br><br>
           <strong> Teach others. </strong>
           Another classic than can probably be applied to a broad range of skills. If you want to make sure you understood something, just explain it to someone else. They will ask you questions and you will have to think about it in depth and do research and it will help you tremendously.
           <br><br>

           All these are skills that could easily be applied to other fields as well, and some may seem quite obvious, but
           in IT often the logical-analytical, the complex thinking and how fast you grasp some concept - skills are focused on by teachers
           and peers, and people who do not excel at those often loose hope and motivation and think they are not good enough for IT.
           I think more focus should be put on the skills I listed above, especially for beginners who still need to gain their tech-confidence.
